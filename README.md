# Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews

Objective: 

In this modern world of technology, people seldom turn to in-people reviews of a food establishment. Smartphone & Website-based apps have been making the rounds for the last couple of years where people leave in their reviews about a particular establishment. Given that, with respect to time, the number of reviews would see a humongous increase and would bring an unclear picture if not classified as per a common set (In this case, positive reviews & negative reviews). This dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories. With this dataset, Iâ€™ll put into use the models to extract meaning from the review to classify the positivity/negativity of the review.
